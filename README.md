# Task 2: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## Objective
To understand and analyze the Titanic dataset using summary statistics and visualizations.

## Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Seaborn
- Matplotlib
- Plotly

## Steps Performed
1. **Loaded the dataset** using Pandas.
2. **Checked for missing values** and printed summary statistics (mean, median, std, etc.).
3. **Plotted histograms** for 'Age' using both Matplotlib and Plotly.
4. **Used boxplots** to analyze 'Fare' distribution by passenger class.
5. **Generated correlation matrix** heatmap using Seaborn.
6. **Created pairplots** to analyze feature relationships.
7. **Used Plotly** to build interactive scatter plots and boxplots.

## Key Insights
- Most passengers were in the 20‚Äì40 age group.
- Fares vary widely across different classes.
- Strong positive correlation between Fare and Pclass.
- Outliers are visible in Fare distribution (especially in 1st class).

## üìÅ Files Included
-'Task-2.ipynb' - Main File
- `titanic.csv` ‚Äì Dataset
- Screenshots

## What I Learned
- How to visually explore data distributions and relationships.
- How to use both static (Matplotlib, Seaborn) and interactive (Plotly) tools.
- The importance of EDA before applying ML models.
